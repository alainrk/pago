## Features

Cashout is an intelligent Telegram bot that leverages AI to make expense tracking effortless. Simply send a message in natural language, and the bot will understand and categorize your transactions automatically.

### AI-Powered Transaction Processing

- **Intelligent Intent Routing**: Just type naturally, no commands needed. The AI understands whether you want to add a transaction, check your weekly summary, search, edit, delete, or export. Simply say "show me this week", "delete expense" or "irish pub 4.50" and the bot figures out the rest. If there is no match or you prefer to do otherwise, you can always fall back to a completely deterministic and classic flow.
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically assigns the right category based on your description.
- **Duplicate Detection**: The AI detects when a new transaction looks like a recent one already saved and asks you to confirm before storing it, preventing accidental double-entries.
- **Flexible Date Recognition**: Understands various date formats (dd/mm, dd-mm-yyyy, "yesterday", etc.).
- **Multi-language Support**: Works with transaction descriptions in any language.

### Transaction Management

- **Quick Entry**: Add expenses and income with a single message.
- **Inline Editing**: Modify amount, category, description, or date before confirming.
- **Bulk Operations**: Edit or delete existing transactions with paginated navigation.
- **Transaction Types**: Track both expenses (18 categories) and income (2 categories).
- **Search and Full Listing**: Find transactions by full text search and category or full listing.
- **Export Functionality**: Download all your transactions as CSV files.

### Financial Insights

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26 or higher
- PostgreSQL Database
- Access to an OpenAI-compatible API model, with its API Key and Endpoint (e.g. DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alainrk/cashout.git
cd cashout
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Copy the example `.env` file in the project root (or set environment variables) and edit it accordingly:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_API_TOKEN='XXXXXXXXXX:AAAA_bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb'
DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres'
OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
OPENAI_BASE_URL='https://api.deepseek.com/v1'
LLM_MODEL='deepseek-v4-flash'
LLM_DISABLE_THINKING='true'
RUN_MODE='webhook' # webhook or polling
WEBHOOK_DOMAIN=''
WEBHOOK_SECRET=''
WEBHOOK_HOST='localhost'
WEBHOOK_PORT='8080'
LOG_LEVEL='info'
# Dev purpose, comma separated. Keep it empty to allow all
ALLOWED_USERS=''
# Seed purpose - set the Telegram ID of the user to seed transactions for
SEED_USER_TG_ID=''
# Web Server Configuration
WEB_HOST=localhost
WEB_PORT=8081
# Session Configuration (optional)
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-session-secret-here
SESSION_DURATION=24h
# Email Service Configuration (for passwordless email login)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
# WebAuthn Configuration (for passkey support)
WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME=Cashout
WEBAUTHN_RP_ID=localhost
WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8081
```

Spin up local infrastructure:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Database Management

Cashout uses a version-based migration system to manage database schema changes.

Use the following commands to manage database migrations:

```bash
# Run all pending migrations
go run ./cmd/migrate/main.go -command up

# Run all pending migrations with another .env file
go run ./cmd/migrate/main.go -command up -env .prod.env

# Create a new migration just by copy-pasting a previous one and editing it accordingly
cp internal/migrations/versions/001*.go internal/migrations/versions/00X_your_migration.go
```

For migrations that support rollback, use the `RegisterMigrationWithRollback` function:

```go
func init() {
    migrations.RegisterMigrationWithRollback("003", "Add email column",
        add_email_column, rollback_email_column)
}

func rollback_email_column(tx *gorm.DB) error {
    return tx.Exec(`ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email`).Error
}
```

## Development

### Building and Running

#### Telegram Bot

```bash
# Build the bot
make build

# Run the bot
make run

# Run the bot with live reloading (requires Air)
make run/live
```

#### Web Server

```bash
# Build the web server
make build-web

# Run the web server
make run-web

# Run the web server with live reloading
make run/live-web
```

#### Both Services

```bash
# Build both applications
make build-all

# Build both for Linux
make build-linux-all

# Note: Running both requires two terminals
# Terminal 1: make run
# Terminal 2: make run-web
```

### Database Seeding

The Dev DB Seeder generates test transaction data for development:

```bash
# Set the user's Telegram ID you want to seed data for
export SEED_USER_TG_ID=123456789

# Seed the database with random transactions
make db/seed
```

The seeder will:

- Generate 5 years of transaction history.
- Create 90% expenses and 10% income transactions.
- Distribute transactions across all categories.
- Ensure at least one salary per month.
- Delete existing transactions before seeding (idempotent).

## Deployment

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

The project includes a complete Docker Compose setup:

```bash
# Start all services (database, bot, web server)
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker compose down
```

This will start:

- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- Telegram bot (webhook mode on port 8080)
- Web dashboard on port 8081
- Automatic database migrations

### Manual Deployment

#### Telegram Bot

The bot can run both in `webhook` and `polling` mode.

**Webhook Mode:**

```env
RUN_MODE='webhook'
WEBHOOK_DOMAIN='https://your-domain.com'
WEBHOOK_SECRET='xxxyyyzzz'
WEBHOOK_PORT='8080'
```

**Polling Mode:**

```env
RUN_MODE='polling'
```

#### Web Server

The web server runs independently and can be configured:

```env
WEB_HOST=0.0.0.0  # For production
WEB_PORT=8081
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-session-secret-here
SESSION_DURATION=24h
```

### LLM Setup

Any OpenAI compatible API LLM can be used:

**Example with DeepSeek:**

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxx'
OPENAI_BASE_URL='https://api.deepseek.com/v1'
LLM_MODEL='deepseek-v4-flash'
LLM_DISABLE_THINKING='true'
```

**Example with OpenAI:**

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxx'
OPENAI_BASE_URL='https://api.openai.com/v1'
LLM_MODEL='gpt-4'
```

## Web Dashboard Usage

### Authentication Options

The web dashboard supports three authentication methods:

1. **Telegram Login** (code-based):
   - Enter your Telegram username.
   - Check Telegram for a 6-digit verification code.
   - Enter the code to access your dashboard.

2. **Email Login** (passwordless):
   - Enter your registered email address.
   - Check your email for a 6-digit verification code.
   - Enter the code to access your dashboard.

3. **Passkey Login** (WebAuthn):
   - Register a passkey from your dashboard settings after initial login.
   - Use biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) on subsequent logins.
   - No codes needed - instant secure access.

### Dashboard Features

1. **Access**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8081` (or your configured domain).
2. **Login**: Choose your preferred authentication method.
3. **Dashboard**: View your financial data with month navigation.
4. **Statistics**: See real-time balance, income, expenses, and transaction counts.
5. **Transactions**:
   - Add new transactions directly from the web interface.
   - Browse detailed transaction history with search and filtering.
   - View transactions by category.
6. **Passkey Management**: Register, view, and delete passkeys for your account.

The web dashboard provides a complementary interface to the Telegram bot, offering:

- Better visualization for large datasets.
- Month-by-month navigation.
- Desktop and mobile-friendly transaction management.
- Multiple secure authentication options.
- Direct transaction creation without needing Telegram.

## HTTP API & SDKs

The dashboard endpoints under `/web/api/*` also accept programmatic clients via
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` in addition to the existing browser session cookie.

### Issuing a token (admin-only, direct DB insert)

There is no token-management UI on purpose (as of now); tokens are inserted manually by an
operator. The plaintext token is shown to the user once and only its SHA-256
hex digest is stored.

```bash
# Generate locally:
TOKEN="cshk_$(openssl rand -base64 24 | tr -d '=+/' | head -c 32)"
HASH=$(printf %s "$TOKEN" | shasum -a 256 | awk '{print $1}')
echo "token=$TOKEN"

# Then in psql, replace <tg_id> with the target user's Telegram ID:
# INSERT INTO api_tokens (tg_id, name, token_hash, prefix)
#   VALUES (<tg_id>, 'my-cli', '<HASH>', substring('<TOKEN>' from 1 for 8));
```

Optional `expires_at` is supported; leave NULL for non-expiring tokens.

### Calling the API

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:8081/web/api/stats?month=2026-05"
```

### OpenAPI spec & generated SDKs

The spec lives at `api/swagger.{yaml,json}` and is generated from `swaggo/swag`
annotations on the handlers. SDKs are committed under `sdks/{python,go,typescript}/`.

```bash
make openapi        # regenerate the spec
make sdks           # regenerate spec + all three SDKs
make sdk-python     # individual languages
make sdk-go
make sdk-ts
```

SDK generation uses the `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` npm wrapper and
requires `npx` and Java 11+ on PATH.

### Consuming the TypeScript SDK (npm / pnpm / yarn)

The TypeScript SDK is generated and committed under `sdks/typescript/`, but a
proper consumer install path is **on standby** until there's a concrete need.

Unlike pip and Go, npm has no first-class way to install a package from a
subdirectory of a git repo, so shipping this SDK to external consumers requires
extra work — either publishing to npm under a real scope, or distributing
packed tarballs. That will be wired up when the first consumer needs it; for
now the generated code sits in the repo as a starting point and is kept in
sync with the OpenAPI spec by `make sdk-ts`.

### Consuming the Python SDK (uv / pip)

The Python SDK is a standard PEP 621 package rooted at `sdks/python/`. uv and
pip can install it directly from this repo using the `subdirectory` fragment:

```bash
# Add it to a uv-managed project
uv add "git+https://github.com/alainrk/cashout.git#subdirectory=sdks/python"

# Or one-off into the current environment
uv pip install "git+https://github.com/alainrk/cashout.git#subdirectory=sdks/python"

# Plain pip works too
pip install "git+https://github.com/alainrk/cashout.git#subdirectory=sdks/python"
```

To pin to a specific commit or tag, append `@<ref>` before the `#`:

```bash
uv add "git+https://github.com/alainrk/cashout.git@v0.1.0#subdirectory=sdks/python"
```

Usage:

```python
import cashout_sdk
from cashout_sdk.api.transactions_api import TransactionsApi

cfg = cashout_sdk.Configuration(
    host="http://localhost:8081/web",
    access_token="cshk_...",
)
with cashout_sdk.ApiClient(cfg) as client:
    stats = TransactionsApi(client).api_stats_get(month="2026-05")
    print(stats)
```

### Consuming the Go SDK

The Go SDK is a Go submodule rooted at `sdks/go/`. Its module path matches its
on-disk location, so it is `go get`-able directly from this repo:

```bash
go get github.com/alainrk/cashout/sdks/go@latest
```

```go
import (
    "context"
    cashout "github.com/alainrk/cashout/sdks/go"
)

func main() {
    cfg := cashout.NewConfiguration()
    cfg.Servers = cashout.ServerConfigurations{{URL: "http://localhost:8081/web"}}
    cfg.DefaultHeader["Authorization"] = "Bearer cshk_..."
    client := cashout.NewAPIClient(cfg)

    stats, _, err := client.TransactionsAPI.
        ApiStatsGet(context.Background()).
        Month("2026-05").
        Execute()
    _ = stats; _ = err
}
```

**Versioning.** Because the SDK lives in a subdirectory, Go expects git tags to
be **prefixed with the subdirectory path** when you cut releases:

```bash
git tag sdks/go/v0.1.0
git push origin sdks/go/v0.1.0
```

Consumers then pin via:

```bash
go get github.com/alainrk/cashout/sdks/go@v0.1.0
```

Until a `sdks/go/vX.Y.Z` tag exists, `@latest` resolves to a pseudo-version
synthesized from the commit (`v0.0.0-<timestamp>-<sha>`). That works for early
adopters but isn't a stable release.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run tests in CI mode
make test-ci

# Run security checks
make sec
```
